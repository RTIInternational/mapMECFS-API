# mapMECFS-API
This repository contains scripts in the python, R, and curl command to access mapMECFS data via the API. 


## About mapMECFS
The mapMECFS website serves as the omics data sharing portal for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) research, created as part of the NIH funded ME/CFS Network. 
This website enables researchers to gain a broader view of ME/CFS by:
- Bringing together the data that researchers have collected across the multiple systems affected by ME/CFS
- Providing a dynamic navigation portal to search across these domains
- Facilitating the integration of complementary data types to offer a new, more complete picture of the disorder

mapMECFS is available to all researchers at https://www.mapmecfs.org/.


## mapMECFS-API Repository
This repository provides detailed documentation of the mapMECFS API to access and search data stored on mapMECFS. Documentation is provided in the curl, python, and R languages. The mapMECFS API is built on the CKAN API, therefore further documentation of available calls is available in the [CKAN API guide](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/)

### Available API Queries
Examples in each programming languages are given for the following activities on mapMECFS.
- List of datasets on mapMECFS
- List of datasets and their metadata on mapMECFS
- Retrieve a list of all tags used on mapMECFS
- Retrieve metadata for a particular dataset on mapMECFS
- Search a particular tag used on mapMECFS
- Search data on mapMECFS according to a specific query

### Creating API Tokens

## mapMECFS Portal Implementation
mapMECFS has been implemented using the CKAN framework (https://ckan.org/). Our custom created plugins for [advanced authentication](https://github.com/RTIInternational/ckanext-advancedauth), [search terms](https://github.com/RTIInternational/ckanext-searchterms), and [summary statistics](https://github.com/RTIInternational/ckanext-summarystats) are publicly available.
